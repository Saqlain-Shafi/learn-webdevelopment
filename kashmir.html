    <h1>KASHMIR</h1>
    <p>The word Kashmir is thought to have been derived from Sanskrit and was referred to as káśmīra.
         A popular local etymology of Kashmira is that it is land desiccated from water.</p>
        <p>Kashmir is cradled high in the lofty green Himalayas and hailed all over the world 
            for its incredible natural beauty.</p>
            <p>Surrounded by mountain peaks, lush green valleys, glistening lakes, temples and 
                spectacular Mughal-era gardens, it has inspired poets through centuries. 
                Kashmir is crisscrossed by chinar tree-lined roads and quaint wooden bridges; 
                and is home to bustling bazaars, sufi shrines and forts.
                Add to this, the charms of flavourful Kashmiri cuisine and apples and walnuts 
                from the lush orchards surrounding it.</p>
